The two horizontal barriers are defined by profit-taking and stop-loss limits, which are a dynamic function of estimated volatility. The third barrier is defined in terms of the number of bars elapsed since the position was taken. If the upper barrier was touched first, we label the observation as a 1. If the lower barrier was touched first, we label the observation as a -1. If the vertical barrier was touched first, we have two choices: the sign of the return, or a 0."
